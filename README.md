- Rails API

When a user signs in, they have access to their home page, a basic two-player chessboard, and all the current lessons. Lessons contain some combination of _slides_ and _puzzles_. _Puzzles_ come in two varieties: _Examples_ and _Tests_. _Examples_ are simply stepped through by the user similar to the way one can step through a recorded chess game on many sites. _Tests_ are chess problems which must be solved correctly in order to continue (or end) the lesson, and are meant to reinforce the content contained in _slides_. Once a lesson is completed the user gains the relevant amount of XP which is added to their total. On the user's home page their designated "Rank" increases with more XP.

#### Features I would like to add in the future:
- Lessons gated by XP/completion
- More animations
- Customizable boards and pieces
- A lot more lessons!

##### All credit to Catherine for the marvelous name!
